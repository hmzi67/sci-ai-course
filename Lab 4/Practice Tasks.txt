Task 1:

Create a new plot that displays the cosine function (z = np.cos(x)) in blue color with a dashed line style, 
along with the sine function (y = np.sin(x)) in red color with a solid line style. 
Use the same x-axis range (0 to 10) and add appropriate labels and title to the plot.


*********************

Task 2:

Create a new figure with three subplots, where each subplot displays a different function:

Subplot 1: y = np.sin(x)
Subplot 2: z = np.cos(x)
Subplot 3: w = np.sin(x) + np.cos(x)
Use the same x-axis range (0 to 10) and add appropriate labels and titles to each subplot. 
Make the subplots have equal widths and heights.

************************

Task 3:

Create a new plot that displays the sine 
function (y = np.sin(x)) in the range of 0 to 20, 
with x-axis 
tick labels appearing at every 5 units. 
Additionally, add a horizontal grid line at y = 0.


*************

Task 4:

Modify the code to create a new figure with two subplots, 
where the first subplot displays 
the sine function (y = np.sin(x)) and the second subplot 
displays the cosine function (z = np.cos(x)) in the 
range of 0 to 10. However, this time, make the subplots 
have different widths. Specifically, 
make the first subplot occupy 40% of the figure width 
and the second subplot occupy 60% of the figure width.
