Task 1: IoU Calculation

Given two rectangles, rectA = (1, 1, 3, 3) 
and rectB = (2, 2, 4, 4), 
calculate the IoU between them.

Task 2: Rectangle Coordinates

Write a function to calculate the area of a 
rectangle given its coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2).

Task 3: IoU Visualization

Modify the provided code to visualize the IoU 
between two rectangles, rectA = (1, 1, 3, 3) and 
rectB = (2, 2, 4, 4), using matplotlib.
